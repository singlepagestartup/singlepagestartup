{"body":"# Problem to solve\n\nThe admin panel needs to be migrated to its updated version for a unified admin experience.\nCurrently, ecommerce.product, ecommerce.attribute, and ecommerce.products-to-attributes act as pilot platforms to debug and resolve integration issues.\nThe migration and stabilization in this pilot scope are required before rolling out to the rest of the components and modules.\n\n# Key details\n\n- Updated admin panel source is located in `apps/drafts`.\n- Portions are already migrated to `apps/host/src/components/admin-panel-draft`.\n- Additional implementation exists in:\n - `libs/modules/ecommerce/frontend/component/src/lib/admin-v2`\n - `libs/shared/frontend/components/src/lib/singlepage/admin-v2`\n- Models involved:\n - `libs/modules/ecommerce/models/product/frontend/component/src/lib/singlepage/admin-v2`\n - `libs/modules/ecommerce/models/attribute/frontend/component/src/lib/singlepage/admin-v2`\n- Relations involved:\n - `libs/modules/ecommerce/relations/products-to-attributes/frontend/component/src/lib/singlepage/admin-v2`\n- Pilot scope note:\n - `ecommerce.product`, `ecommerce.attribute`, and `ecommerce.products-to-attributes` are used as a pilot platform to identify and fix migration/integration issues first.\n - Only after the pilot scope is stabilized and validated should the migration approach be rolled out to the remaining components/modules.\n\n# Implementation notes\n\n1. Review the updated admin panel implementation across all listed locations.\n2. Consolidate logic and shared UI components; remove duplicated code paths.\n3. Ensure consistent typing and integration between models and relations in the pilot scope.\n4. Fix discovered migration issues in pilot modules (architecture, data flow, UX behavior).\n5. Finalize pilot validation criteria and document rollout gates.\n6. After pilot stabilization, scale migration to remaining components/modules.\n\n# References\n\n - apps/drafts\n- apps/host/src/components/admin-panel-draft\n- libs/modules/ecommerce/frontend/component/src/lib/admin-v2\n- libs/shared/frontend/components/src/lib/singlepage/admin-v2\n- libs/modules/ecommerce/models/product/frontend/component/src/lib/singlepage/admin-v2\n- libs/modules/ecommerce/models/attribute/frontend/component/src/lib/singlepage/admin-v2\n- libs/modules/ecommerce/relations/products-to-attributes/frontend/component/src/lib/singlepage/admin-v2","comments":[],"labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOI9TQws8AAAACZlR7NA","name":"area:host","description":"Changes in apps/host","color":"1D76DB"}],"number":142,"title":"Implement the updated admin panel","url":"https://github.com/singlepagestartup/singlepagestartup/issues/142"}
