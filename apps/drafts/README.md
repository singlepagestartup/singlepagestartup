# Drafts Workspace

`apps/drafts` is a staging area for AI-generated frontend drafts.

## Goals

- Keep generated code isolated from production apps.
- Support multiple draft formats (`html`, `react`, `next`) with one contract.
- Make review and promotion predictable (`incoming -> approved -> archived`).

## Directory Layout

- `incoming/` - new drafts generated by AI tools.
- `approved/` - drafts accepted by developers for integration.
- `archived/` - old or rejected drafts kept for reference.
- `manifest.schema.json` - contract for each draft descriptor.
- `examples/` - reference examples for AI prompts and developers.

## Required Draft Contract

Each draft must contain a `manifest.json` next to its source files.

Minimum fields:

- `id`: unique draft id.
- `title`: human-readable name.
- `type`: `html` | `react` | `next`.
- `entry`: entry file relative to the draft folder.
- `status`: `incoming` | `approved` | `archived`.

Optional fields:

- `description`
- `tags`
- `createdAt`
- `updatedAt`

## Recommended Draft Folder Structure

```txt
apps/drafts/incoming/<draft-id>/
  manifest.json
  src/
    ...
```

## Typical Flow

1. AI generates a draft into `incoming/<draft-id>`.
2. Developer reviews the result and smoke-tests it manually.
3. If accepted, move folder to `approved/<draft-id>`.
4. If stale/rejected, move folder to `archived/<draft-id>`.

## Guardrails

- Do not place backend code here.
- Do not import from `apps/api` or backend libraries.
- Keep drafts self-contained.
