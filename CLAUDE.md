# Claude Instructions (SPS)

Use this file as the Claude-specific entry point for working in this repository.

## Repository Overview

SinglePageStartup (SPS) is an Nx monorepo with:

- API app: `apps/api` (Bun + Hono).
- Host app: `apps/host` (Next.js App Router).
- MCP server: `apps/mcp` (tools/resources for creating data in apps/api by MCP).
- Business modules: `libs/modules/<module>`.

Each module contains:

- `models/<model>` and `relations/<relation>` with backend and frontend layers.
- Module-level docs: `libs/modules/<module>/README.md`.
- Per-model docs: `libs/modules/<module>/models/<model>/README.md`.
- Per-relation docs: `libs/modules/<module>/relations/<relation>/README.md`.

## Documentation order

- Root overview: `README.md`
- Module summary: `libs/modules/<module>/README.md`
- Entity docs: `libs/modules/<module>/models/<model|relation>/README.md`.

## Key rules (short)

- TailwindCSS only, no ad-hoc CSS.
- Always use SDK providers for data access from `libs/modules/<module>/models/<model|relation>/sdk/<client|server>`.
- Use relation components with `variant="find"` and filter via `apiProps.params.filters.and`.
- Backend only hosted in `apps/api/app.ts`.

If anything is unclear, read the relevant README files instead of guessing.

## Environment & Requirements

- Node.js 20+, npm 10+ (as per package engines).
- Bun runtime installed (used by `apps/api`).
- Docker & Docker Compose **required** for Postgres and Redis (the `./up.sh` script expects Docker to be available on the agent machine).

## Setup & Execution

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Bootstrap infrastructure & migrations (requires Docker): `./up.sh`
  - Creates environment files, starts Postgres (`apps/db`) and Redis (`apps/redis`), then runs `npx nx run api:db:migrate`.
- Start API server: `npm run api:dev`
- Start host (Next.js) server: `npm run host:dev`

## Test format (BDD)

All test files (`*.spec.*`, `*.test.*`, `*.e2e.*`) must use the repository BDD format:

- Top-level JSDoc with `BDD Suite` or `BDD Scenario`.
- Mandatory `Given`, `When`, `Then` lines in that header.
- Behavior-first test naming; avoid inline `Given/When/Then` comments in test bodies.
- JSDoc with `BDD Suite` or `BDD Scenario` above test case.

## Development Workflow Commands

The unified development workflow uses commands in `.claude/commands/core/`.

**Start here in most cases:**

- **`/core/next [issue-number]`** - Auto-detects the current phase from GitHub Project status and runs the correct command. No need to open GitHub Project separately.

**Individual phase commands (if you need direct control):**

- **`/core/00-create`** - Create new issue (→ Research Needed)
- **`/core/10-research`** - Research issue (Research Needed → Research in Review)
- **`/core/20-plan`** - Create implementation plan (Ready for Plan → Plan in Review)
- **`/core/30-implement`** - Implement approved plan (Ready for Dev → Code Review)

**After phases that require human review** (Research in Review, Plan in Review): manually advance the issue status in GitHub Project, then run `/core/next` again.

**After PR merge**: manually move the issue to "Done" in GitHub Project.

For special-purpose tasks, see `.claude/commands/README.md` for the full command list.

## Code Review Checklist

- Enforce TypeScript interface-first style, PascalCase components, and consistent export order.
- Confirm frontend changes obey the Tailwind/shadcn preset rules, variant structure, and SDK-based data fetching.
- Confirm backend changes preserve the layered architecture (repository/service/controller) and never bypass shared utilities (logging, caching, RBAC, revalidation).
- Ensure migrations/seeds or Nx targets are updated when schema changes.
