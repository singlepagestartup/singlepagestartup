# Claude Project Configuration — Example
# Copy this file to .claude/.env and fill in the values.
# See .claude/README.md for setup instructions.
#
# GITHUB_LOGIN and GITHUB_REPO are auto-detected from `gh` CLI — no need to set them here.
# PROJECT_NODE_ID, STATUS_FIELD_ID, and status option UUIDs are resolved dynamically at runtime.

# GitHub Project number (from: gh project list --me  OR  gh project list --owner ORG)
GITHUB_PROJECT_NUMBER=

# Who owns the GitHub Project — may differ from GITHUB_LOGIN (e.g. an org)
# Leave empty to use the repo owner (auto-detected from gh CLI).
GITHUB_PROJECT_OWNER=

# "user" or "organization" — determines which GraphQL entity to query
# Default: "user". Set to "organization" if the project belongs to a GitHub org.
GITHUB_PROJECT_OWNER_TYPE=user
