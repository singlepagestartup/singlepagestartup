# Server-Side Utilities

This library is intended for server-side utilities in the SinglePageStartup (SPS) project. Currently, it's a placeholder for future server-side utility functions.

## Structure

```
src/
└── lib/
    └── index.ts          # Main entry point
```

## Purpose

This library is designed to contain:

- Server-side rendering utilities
- API handling helpers
- Data processing functions
- Security utilities
- Performance optimizations

## Current Status

The library is currently empty and serves as a placeholder for future development. It follows the standard SPS project structure and is ready for implementation of server-side utilities.
