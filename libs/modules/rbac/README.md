# RBAC Module

## 1. Purpose of the Module

The RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) module is the core security module of the project, responsible for authentication, authorization, and access control management.

### It solves the following tasks:

- Manages user authentication and identity verification (`Identity`)
- Handles role-based access control (`Role`, `Action`)
- Manages subject (user/entity) management (`Subject`)
- Provides widget-based access control interfaces (`Widget`)
- Controls access to resources across all modules

### Typical use cases:

- User authentication
- Role assignment and management
- Permission and action control
- Access restriction to resources
- Security context management
- Integration with other modules for access control

### The problem it solves:

Provides a comprehensive security framework that ensures proper access control and authorization across the entire project, while maintaining flexibility and extensibility in security policies.

## 5. Standardized API for Models

- Models use the standard API endpoints described in Backend Development Standards
- Support for standard CRUD operations and extended operations (`dump`, `seed`, `find-or-create`, `bulk-create`, `bulk-update`) if needed
- Additional endpoints for authentication and authorization
- Security-specific endpoints for session management
- Access control verification endpoints
