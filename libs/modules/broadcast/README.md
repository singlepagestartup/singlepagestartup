# Broadcast Module

## 1. Purpose of the Module

The Broadcast module is designed to implement a broadcasting system within the project.

### It solves the following tasks:

- Manages broadcasting channels (`Channel`)
- Handles message broadcasting (`Message`)
- Supports various message types and formats
- Enables channel-based broadcasting

### Typical use cases:

- Implementing broadcast systems, like rabbitmq
- Building real-time updates
- Managing broadcast channels

### The problem it solves:

Quickly integrating a robust real-time messaging system into any website without building complex communication infrastructure from scratch.

## 2. Models in the Module

| Model   | Purpose                                     |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Channel | Managing channels for broadcasting messages |
| Message | Handling message broadcasting               |

---

## 3. Model Relations

| Relation           | Purpose                                                       |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ChannelsToMessages | Many-to-many relation: channels can contain multiple messages |

## 4. Model Specifics

### Channel

#### Main fields:

- `id`: unique channel identifier
- `createdAt`: creation timestamp
- `updatedAt`: last update timestamp
- `variant`: channel display variant
- `title`: channel title
- `adminTitle`: title for admin panel
- `slug`: unique URL-friendly identifier

#### Variants:

- default

### Message

#### Main fields:

- `id`: unique message identifier
- `createdAt`: creation timestamp
- `updatedAt`: last update timestamp
- `variant`: message display variant
- `expiresAt`: message expiration timestamp
- `payload`: message content/data

#### Variants:

- default

## 5. Standardized API for Models

- Models use the standard API endpoints described in Backend Development Standards
- Support for standard CRUD operations and extended operations (`dump`, `seed`, `find-or-create`, `bulk-create`, `bulk-update`) if needed
- Additional endpoints for real-time message delivery and channel management

---

## 6. Special Notes

- All data fetching is handled strictly through SDK Providers and Relation Components
- Components are structured according to the standard SPS architecture (`ParentComponent` â†’ `ChildComponent`)
- Supports real-time message updates through WebSocket connections
- Channels can be configured for different communication patterns
- Integration with real-time services is handled through standardized interfaces
- Implements secure message delivery and channel access control

## Summary

- The description begins with the business purpose
- Accurate model and relation structure
- Covers key data management and frontend implementation features
- Includes real-time messaging capabilities
- Supports flexible communication patterns
- Handles various message types and channel configurations
