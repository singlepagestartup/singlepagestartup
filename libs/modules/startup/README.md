# Startup Module

## 1. Purpose of the Module

The Startup module is a special module designed for implementing project-specific business logic. It serves as the main place where developers using SinglePageStartup (SPS) can define their custom models, relations, and business rules.

### It solves the following tasks:

- Provides a space for custom business logic implementation
- Allows creation of project-specific models
- Enables definition of custom relations between models
- Supports integration with core SPS modules
- Facilitates implementation of unique business requirements

### Typical use cases:

- Creating custom business entities
- Defining project-specific workflows
- Implementing unique business rules
- Adding custom integrations
- Extending core SPS functionality
- Building project-specific features

### The problem it solves:

Bridges the gap between the generic functionality provided by core SPS modules and the specific business requirements of individual projects. While the SPS team provides common modules for typical functionality, the Startup module allows project teams to implement their unique business logic.

## 2. Models in the Module

| Model  | Purpose                                   |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Widget | Managing project-specific widget displays |

Note: Additional models are created by project teams based on their specific business requirements.

---

## 3. Model Relations

Note: Relations are defined by project teams based on their specific business requirements. The module supports creating any necessary relations between custom models and core SPS modules.

---

## 4. Model Specifics

### Widget

#### Main fields:

- id: Unique identifier (UUID)
- className: CSS class name for styling
- title: Display title of the widget
- createdAt: Timestamp of creation
- updatedAt: Timestamp of last update
- variant: Widget display variant (default: "default")
- adminTitle: Title shown in admin interface
- slug: URL-friendly unique identifier

#### Variants:

- default

### Custom Models

Project teams can create any models needed for their specific business requirements. These models should follow the SPS architecture standards:

- Use standard model structure (backend, frontend, sdk)
- Follow naming conventions
- Implement proper relations
- Use standardized API patterns
- Support component variants

---

## 5. Standardized API for Models

- Custom models should follow the standard API patterns described in Backend Development Standards
- Support standard CRUD operations
- Can implement additional endpoints for specific business logic
- Should maintain consistency with SPS architecture
- Must follow security best practices

---

## 6. Special Notes

- All data fetching is handled strictly through SDK Providers and Relation Components
- Components are structured according to the standard SPS architecture (`ParentComponent` â†’ `ChildComponent`)
- Custom models should integrate with core SPS modules
- Business logic should be properly documented
- Security considerations must be maintained
- Performance optimizations should be implemented
- Code should follow SPS coding standards
- Testing requirements must be met

---

## Summary

- The description begins with the business purpose
- Provides framework for custom business logic implementation
- Supports project-specific model creation
- Enables custom relation definitions
- Maintains SPS architecture standards
- Facilitates integration with core modules
- Supports unique business requirements
- Ensures maintainability and scalability
