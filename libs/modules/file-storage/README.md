# File Storage Module

## 1. Purpose of the Module

The File Storage module is designed to handle file management and storage within the project.

### It solves the following tasks:

- Manages file uploads and storage (`File`)
- Provides widget-based file displays (`Widget`)
- Handles file metadata and organization
- Supports file previews and downloads
- Integrates with other modules for file attachments

### Typical use cases:

- Uploading and storing files
- Managing file metadata
- Displaying files in widgets
- Previewing files
- Downloading files
- Attaching files to other entities

### The problem it solves:

Centralized file management system that can be used by other modules to store and manage their files without implementing their own file storage solutions.

## 3. Model Relations

| Relation       | Purpose                                                   |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |

## 5. Standardized API for Models

- Models use the standard API endpoints described in Backend Development Standards
- Support for standard CRUD operations and extended operations (`dump`, `seed`, `find-or-create`, `bulk-create`, `bulk-update`) if needed
- Additional endpoints for file uploads and downloads

---

## 6. Component Variants

| Model  | Component Variants                                              |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| File   | Variants for file display: card, list, grid, preview            |
| Widget | Variants for widget layouts: file grid, file list, file preview |

Components are implemented either in the `startup/` or `singlepage/` structure.

## 7. Special Notes

- All data fetching is handled strictly through SDK Providers and Relation Components
- Components are structured according to the standard SPS architecture (`ParentComponent` â†’ `ChildComponent`)
- Files support various types and previews
- Widgets support different display layouts
- Integration with other modules for file attachments
- Secure file storage and access control
